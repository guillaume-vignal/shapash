### Enhancing Shapash Feature/Contribution Plots: Jittering, Smart Selection, and Volume Representation

Shapash is an innovative library for machine learning interpretability, offering various tools to help understand model predictions. Three notable enhancements in Shapash's feature/contribution plots include jittering points on violin plots, smart selection for diverse class representation, and volume representation via curves and bars. These features significantly improve the clarity and interpretability of the plots, making it easier for users to draw insights from the data.

#### 1. Jittering Points on Violin Plot

Violin plots in Shapash provide a detailed distribution of feature contributions, but overlapping points can obscure individual values. Jittering, or adding random noise to the points, disperses them slightly along the x-axis. This prevents overlap and makes each point distinctly visible.

Here's the key snippet illustrating jittering:

```python
fig.add_scatter(
    x=feature_values_array
    + np.random.uniform(
        -0.1, 0.1, size=len(feature_values_array)
    ),  # Jittering x-coordinates
    y=contributions.values.flatten(),
    mode="markers",
    hovertext=hv_text,
    hovertemplate=hovertemplate,
    text=text_groups_features,
    showlegend=False,
)
```

  <img src="img_medium/jittering2.png" alt="Violin Plot With Jittering" style="width: 45%;"/>
</div>

**Value Derived from Jittering:**

- **Enhanced Visibility:** Points are more spread out, making it easier to distinguish individual contributions.
- **Better Interpretation:** Users can accurately see the distribution and density of data points without overlap.
- **Improved Aesthetics:** The plot looks less cluttered and more visually appealing.

#### 2. Smart Selection for Diverse Class Representation

Shapash employs a smart sampling strategy to ensure a diverse representation of classes in the dataset. This approach involves clustering the data and sampling points from each cluster. By doing so, it avoids over-representation of any particular class and ensures that the selected points represent the overall distribution of the data.

Here's the function that handles smart selection:

```python
def _subset_sampling(
    self, selection=None, max_points=2000, col=None, col_value_count=0
):
    if col_value_count > 10:
        from sklearn.cluster import MiniBatchKMeans

        kmeans = MiniBatchKMeans(n_clusters=10, random_state=0)
        kmeans.fit(data[[col]] if col else data)
        data["group"] = kmeans.predict(data)
    else:
        data["group"] = (
            data.index % 10 if col is None else data[col].apply(lambda x: int(x % 10))
        )

    idx_list = []
    for group in data["group"].unique():
        data_group = data[data["group"] == group]
        sample_size = min(len(data_group), max_points // 10)
        idx_list += data_group.sample(n=sample_size, random_state=0).index.to_list()
    return idx_list
```

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">
  <img src="img_medium/smart_subset1.png" alt="Violin Plot Without Jittering" style="width: 45%;"/>
  <img src="img_medium/smart_subset2.png" alt="Violin Plot With Jittering" style="width: 45%;"/>
</div>


**Value Derived from Smart Selection:**

- **Balanced Representation:** Ensures that different classes are fairly represented, leading to more reliable interpretations.
- **Avoids Bias:** Prevents the plot from being dominated by majority classes, highlighting contributions from minority classes.
- **Efficient Sampling:** Even with large datasets, this method effectively samples a manageable number of points without losing representativeness.

#### 3. Volume Representation via Curves and Bars

Shapash represents the volume of data points using curves for continuous variables and bars for discrete variables. This dual approach provides an accurate visual summary of how features are distributed across their range and how they contribute to the model's predictions.

Here's the code snippet illustrating volume representation:

```python
if feature_values.iloc[:, 0].dtype.kind in "biufc":
    from sklearn.neighbors import KernelDensity

    kde = KernelDensity(
        bandwidth=(feature_values_array.max() - feature_values_array.min()) / 100,
        kernel="epanechnikov",
    ).fit(feature_values_array[:, None])
    xs = np.linspace(min(feature_values_array), max(feature_values_array), 1000)
    log_dens = kde.score_samples(xs[:, None])
    y_upper = np.exp(log_dens) * h / (np.max(np.exp(log_dens)) * 3) + contributions_min
    y_lower = np.full_like(y_upper, contributions_min)
else:
    feature_values_counts = feature_values.value_counts()
    xs = feature_values_counts.index.get_level_values(0).sort_values()
    y_upper = (
        feature_values_counts.loc[xs] / feature_values_counts.sum()
    ).values.flatten() / 3 + contributions_min
    y_lower = np.full_like(y_upper, contributions_min)

density_plot = go.Scatter(
    x=np.concatenate([pd.Series(xs), pd.Series(xs)[::-1]]),
    y=pd.concat([pd.Series(y_upper), pd.Series(y_lower)[::-1]]),
    fill="toself",
    hoverinfo="none",
    showlegend=False,
    line={"color": self._style_dict["contrib_distribution"]},
)
fig.add_trace(density_plot)
```

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">
  <img src="img_medium/density_curve1.png" alt="Violin Plot Without Jittering" style="width: 45%;"/>
  <img src="img_medium/density_curve2.png" alt="Violin Plot With Jittering" style="width: 45%;"/>
</div>

**Value Derived from Volume Representation:**

- **Intuitive Understanding:** Continuous variables' distributions are shown smoothly, while discrete variables are clearly delineated.
- **Data Density Insights:** Users can quickly grasp where data points are concentrated and how they contribute to predictions.
- **Improved Readability:** The use of curves and bars simplifies the visual interpretation, making it easy to identify key patterns and anomalies.

### Conclusion

The enhancements in Shapash's feature/contribution plots—jittering points, smart selection for diverse class representation, and volume representation via curves and bars—significantly boost the interpretability and usability of the visualizations. These features allow users to gain deeper insights into their models' behavior, leading to more informed decision-making and better understanding of machine learning models. By making these visualizations clearer and more representative, Shapash continues to be a valuable tool for data scientists and analysts.
